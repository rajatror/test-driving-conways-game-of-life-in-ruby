# Test Driving Conways Game of Life in Ruby

This repository holds assets used to build the book. The source code for the
implementation is located elsewhere.

If you have feedback, noticed some poor grammar, have a question, or found a bug
please create an
[issue](https://github.com/zspencer/test-driving-conways-game-of-life-in-ruby/issues).

## Motivation

While facilitating a code retreat I noticed that there was a much higher number
of people just beginning their programming journey.

This prompted me to introduce a constraint of pairing novices with
professionals.

The result of these pairings was many of the junior developers were introduced
to a language beyond their chosen beginning language for the first time.
Thankfully, they still learned quite a bit about programming concepts like
static typing, different testing formats (xUnit vs Spec), and leveraging generic
types.

However this meant they didn't get to see good practices for test driven
development in their chosen primary language.

This seeks to rectify that by providing a step-by-step walk through of
implementing Conways Game of Life in the Ruby programming language. Future
versions may include JavaScript, Java, C# or Clojure.

## Version

This book is currently very much in alpha. I expect to reach an initial 1.0
release within a few months.
