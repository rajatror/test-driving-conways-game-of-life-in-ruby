# Writing Your First Test

Now that we have a high level grasp of Conway's game of life, test driven
design, refactoring, the rules of simple design, and outside-in development it's
time to write our first test.

To do this we need to:

1. Install Ruby and the MiniTest testing library.
2. Create a project on our file system or in Cloud9, for those on Windows.
3. Write a failing test and run it to make sure the tests are working.
